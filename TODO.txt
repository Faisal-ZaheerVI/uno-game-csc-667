Create Games:
    - (Optional) Fix link redirect when user creates new game? 
    (Currently goes to /games/create literal link instead of /game/:id)

Join Games: 
    - Check to see if user_id that joined is already part of the game_id 
    (don't want i.e. game_id = 1 having two players identified as user_id = 5, want 4 unique user_id players)

    - Find place on Lobby Page for Chat + Chatbox
    - Find place on Game page for Chat + Chatbox
