Game:
    - Implement interactions in Game
        - User plays a card
            - (DONE) Is the user in the game? Do they own the card? Is it their turn?
            - Modify card to discard, current_player = 0, move current_player = 1 to
            next player by order # (if order = 4, go back to order = 1)
            - If reverse is played, change direction to -1, iterate through player's turns backwards
                - Implement iterating through players turn based on direction (1 or -1)
            - If +2 or +4 is played -> Give next player +2 or +4 cards
                - Next player who gets card based on direction! (1 or -1)
            - If Wild or +4 played -> Somehow prompt to choose a color?
                - Javascript alert input prompt to get color?
        - User draws a card (draw only one card?)
            - Is it their turn?
    - Implement win condition
    ... Any more???
