GAME LOGIC:
    - (FOR LATER) Fix weird double click to do most interactions?
        - Rarely is one click for interactions (i.e. clicking card to play)
    - Implement interactions in Game
        - PLAYS CARD:
            - Special cards/interactions:
                - Reverse: Changes direction field in "games"
                - Skip: Skips over next player  
                    - Check direction (1 or -1)
                    - Then add/subtract 2 to next player order
                    (changes current_player based on new player order)
                - +2 cards:
                    - Add 2 draw pile cards to next player
                        (calculate normal order based on direction 1 or -1)
                    - Calculate new order for skipping over player
                - Wild cards:
                    - +4 cards:
                        = Choose color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
                        - Add 4 draw pile cards to next player
                            (calculate normal order based on direction 1 or -1)
                        - Calculate new order for skipping over player
                        - Acts as a chosen color card with any value
                    - Wild:
                        - Just choosing color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
                        - Acts as a chosen color card with any value
                    - (Javascript alert input prompt to get color?)
        - DRAWS CARD:
            - Incorportate /games/:id/draw into +2/+4 card plays???
    - WIN CONDITION:
        - When a player has no more cards
        - End the game
            - (DONE-ish?) Stop updating gameState?
                - Safely disable Draw button (or remove?)
            - Post an alert or message on screen as to who won?
    - (OPTIONAL) CALL UNO! feature
        - Checks if user is in game, check if its user's turn
        - Checks if user has two cards (about to play a card)
        - Displays message to socket that user has called Uno??
        - Check on next player's turn to call out previous player's not calling Uno
            - If correct, give previous player 4 cards?
